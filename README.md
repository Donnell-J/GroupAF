### How to play

Exploration: \
Point and Click; Use your mouse to click on an area of terrain, your hero and allies will walk towards it.\
In the exploration scene, there are interactable objects that will trigger combat events, you can interact by clicking on them.\
There are 2 types of triggers:\
  One where you do not get to decide whether or not to accept the combat.\
  Another is where you can temporarily decline the combat to further explore the scene.\
Camera moves with WASD, zooms in and out using scroll wheel, and rotates by holding middle mouse button and moving your mouse.\

Combat:\
Turn-based combat. You and the other heroes will all draw 5 cards at the start of the game. \
Each hero has their own deck with unique cards.\
You will not draw new cards into your deck until every hero has 0 cards left.\
Play cards one by one to deal damage and ultimately kill all the enemies.\
Enemies show their intentions as text shown above their character.\
Click and drag a card onto an enemy to deal damage or apply a status to them.\
Some cards can be dragged onto yourself or allies, such as block or heal cards. If block is applied it will show up as a (+block) in the health bar.\
Some cards apply a status, if someone is affected by a status it will show under the health bar as a coloured square.\
  Stun (yellow) - lose turn.\
  Vulnerable (red) - take twice as much damage.\
  Weakened (beige)  - deal half as much damage.\
  Strengthen (grey) - deal twice as much damage.\
  Poisoned (green) - take x damage for y turns.\
  Barricade (turquoise) - block is not lost at the end of your turn. \
Cards can be combined by pressing the combination button and selecting 2 cards, this will create a much stronger card. However, not all cards can be combined, every hero has a select number of combos.\
Once a combined card is created, it will show up in your hand and can be played.\ 
As 2 cards are used to create a combination card, your hand will have 1 less card than everyone else. As you can only draw new cards when every hero has run out of cards, this means you will lose a turn, in return for a stronger card to play.\
If all heroes have died, you lose the combat. If you kill all the enemies you win the combat.\
Winning the combat will display a rewards screen, where for each hero you can either choose 1 out of 3 shown cards, or to increase their maximum health.\
